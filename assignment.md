1. Design a sequential circuit that functions as a 2-bit binary counter. The counter should count up from 00 to 11 and then reset to 00.
    - Use D flip-flops constructed using NMOS and PMOS pass transistors to build the circuit.
    - Draw a schematic diagram of the sequential circuit, showing the connection of D flip-flops and the necessary control signals.

2. Design a digital timer circuit that counts seconds and minutes and displays the time in a suitable format (e.g., HH:MM). Use D flip-flops and D latches in your design.
    - Determine the number of D flip-flops and D latches required for the timer based on the desired time range and precision
    - Determine the number of transistors required in the schematic of this circuit.

3. Compare and contrast the characteristics, behavior, and applications of D latches and D flip-flops to gain a deeper understanding of these components and their suitability for different scenarios.
