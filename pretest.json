      "question": "1. What frequency clock source will produce clock waveforms having a period equal to 5 us (5 microseconds)? ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "5 MHz",
        "b": "0.2 MHz",
        "c": "2 MHz",
        "d": "10 MHz"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. To calculate the period of a waveform, we use the formula T = 1/f, where T is the period and f is the frequency. In this case, T = 1/5 MHz = 0.2 microseconds. Since the desired period is 5 microseconds, 5 MHz would not produce the correct waveform.",
        "b": "Correct. Calculating the period using T = 1/f, we get T = 1/0.2 MHz = 5 microseconds. Therefore, a clock source with a frequency of 0.2 MHz would produce clock waveforms with a period equal to 5 microseconds.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Frequency of 2 MHz would result in a period of 0.5 microseconds (T = 1/2 MHz = 0.5 microseconds), which is not the desired period of 5 microseconds.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Using the formula T = 1/f, a frequency of 10 MHz would yield a period of 0.1 microseconds (T = 1/10 MHz = 0.1 microseconds), which is not the desired period of 5 microseconds."

      "question": "2. On what parameters do the output of D flip flop depend?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Independent of both previous state and input",
        "b": "Both on previous state and input",
        "c": "Only on the previous state",
        "d": "Only on input D"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The output of a D flip flop depends on the input D and the clock, not independent of both.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The output does not depend only on the previous state; it is determined by the input D at the clock edge.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The output is not determined by both previous state and input in a D flip flop.",
        "d": "Correct. The output of a D flip flop is set by the D input at the clock edge."

      "question": "3. Which statement is true about D latch",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The output follows the input everytime",
        "b": "The output follows the input when clock is high",
        "c": "The output follows the input when the clock is low",
        "d": "The output never follows the input"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The output of a D latch does not follow the input at all times; it depends on the clock signal.",
        "b": "Correct. The output follows the input when the clock is high.",
        "c": "Incorrect. When the clock is low, the output holds its previous value, not the input.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The output does follow the input under certain conditions."

    {
      "question": "4. Which latch has the property of either retaining or toggling the previous value ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "D-Latch",
        "b": "T-Latch",
        "c": "SR-Latch",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A D-latch does not have a toggle function; it stores the input value based on the clock.",
        "b": "Correct. A T-latch can retain or toggle its previous value depending on the toggle input.",
        "c": "Incorrect. An SR-latch sets or resets the output but does not toggle based on previous value.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There is a correct option among the above choices."

      "question": "5. Which statement below is the apt definition of flip flop",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Latch",
        "b": "Coupled latch",
        "c": "De-coupled latch",
        "d": "Clocked latch"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A latch is not the same as a flip flop; flip flops are clocked devices.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Coupled latch does not specifically define a flip flop.",
        "c": "Incorrect. De-coupled latch is not a standard term for flip flop.",
        "d": "Correct. A flip flop is a clocked latch that stores data based on clock transitions."
